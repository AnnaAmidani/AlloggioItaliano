<b>Alloggio Italiano </b>is a free access web portal that displays <b><u>about 40 thousand &quot;non-hotel&quot; lodging facilities</u></b> spread
throughout Italy.
They are listed according to their placement (<i>region</i>, <i>province</i>, <i>municipality/district</i>), to the hospitality offered
(<i>roomrental/guesthouse</i>, <i>greenhotel/countryhouse</i>, <i>bed&amp;breakfast</i>, <i>hostel</i>, <i>refuge</i>) and it is possible
to get in touch with them via
postal address, phone, mobile, fax, e-mail, web site.
The details you find on Alloggio Italiano are listed in directories of public domain and thus they might be incomplete or erroneous; only
the facility managers are allowed to include further data (such as <i>detailed description</i>, <i>features</i>,<i> services offered</i>
and <i>availability</i>).<br/><br/>
Furthermore Alloggio Italiano gives information on <i>events and shows</i>, <i>festivals and trade fairs</i>, <i>exhibitions and museums</i>,
<i>courses and paths</i>,
organized nearby the accommodation facilities. The managers are invited to highlight these events since the news are referred to the
structure which has first published them and in so doing the potential guest might plan his stay based also on specific interest he will
find inside the site search engine.<br/><br/>
Although the structures that are not in compliance with the assumption: &quot;short period of stay in non-hotel&quot; are left off the portal
Alloggio Italiano (typically hotels, camping grounds, holiday villages, etc.), it might still be needed to carry out an
assestement in order to verify the characteristics of some of the facilities already included.
At the present time there is a bit of confusion on the Internet regarding &quot;hotel like establishments&quot;
and &quot;non-hotel facilities&quot;
(the ones this web site is about) mainly because the first ones are expanding their offer toward the client base of the second ones.
As an example it is to distinctly separate a &quot;B&amp;B kind of service&quot; compared to a real &quot;
B&amp;B facility&quot; that is a private accommodation
where the owner lives.<br/><br/>


<b>Roomrental:</b> Roomrentas are accomodation facilities made of no more than six rooms for a maxixmum of 12 beds. Such rooms are to be located in maximum 2 furnished flats in the same bulidings where lodging and other services are offered.
<br/><br/>
<b>Agritourism/Countryhouse:</b> Agritourism has been conceived as a way to develop and enrich the  farming activity thus allowing an extra income. Hospitality is given in rural areas by country houses which are bind to serve meals and beverage made of ingredients produced in the farm itself or in the neibourghhood.
The guest, beside the offer of lodging and local food, may find a variety of ricreational and cultural opportunities, sports, excursions, training courses focused on the rural environment.
<br/><br/>
<b>Bed and Breakfast:</b> Bed&amp;Breakfast, usually referred us B&amp;B is a kind of informal accomodation, sometimes seasonal, set up by families in the free rooms of their house; use of bathroom (seldom shared) and breakfast complete the offer. Since the local authorities issue the relevant rules the may differe from region to region, but usually 3 rooms with a total of 6 beds is the standard. Breakfast often consists of prepacked food because B&amp;B lack the necessary licence to cook and serve fresh food. Dayly cleaning of room and bathroom, bed clothes, towels, heating are always included.
<br/><br/>
<b>Hostel:</b> The hostels are large accomodation facilities owned or managed by public bodies, religious associations, non profit organizations that offer low cost hospitality to purse social, cultural, religious objectives. Youth hostels are suitable for young people travelling alone or in groups and where rooms and dormitories are shared.
Sometimes hostels are equipped so that the guests are autonomous in the management of their stay.
<br/><br/>
<b>Mountain hut:</b> The mountain huts are structures fitted to offer hospitality and refuge in isolated mountain areas reachable only via trecking on mule track, rough tracks, glaciers, moraines. Opened during the summer season they are often the starting point to high quote excursions and climbs. The majority of mountain huts belongs to CAI - Club Alpino Italiano (Italian Mountaineering Association), but also to other free time organizations and only seldom are privately owned.
